    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        A few years ago, a close friend noticed my anxiety and<br>
        suggested I try meditating. I gave it an honest attempt<br>
        during my transition from undergrad to grad school,<br>
        but eventually, life got in the way, and I let it go.<br>
        Around the same time, my aunt introduced me to yoga.<br>
        I instantly connected with it and practiced consistently<br>
        for a couple of years until the pandemic disrupted<br>
        my routine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though I paused, the impact of those early experiences<br>
        stayed with me. As the pandemic began to wane,<br>
        I found myself finishing grad school and facing<br>
        the uncertainty of job hunting—stressful, to say the least!<br>
        It was then that I decided to revisit yoga and meditation.<br>
        This time, I truly embraced them, integrating both into<br>
        my daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since then, I’ve been practicing yoga and meditation<br>
        every day. I pursued further training, completing<br>
        a yoga teacher certification, a mindfulness-based<br>
        stress reduction course, and attending a 10-day<br>
        meditation retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, I balance my career as a data scientist at<br>
        a university with my passion for yoga and meditation.<br>
        I know how challenging it can be to incorporate<br>
        these practices into a busy schedule. But I also know<br>
        the profound benefits they offer. My goal is to share<br>
        this journey with you, helping you discover the benefits<br>
        that yoga and meditation have brought me—and<br>
        countless others—over the centuries.
