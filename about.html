    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        A few years ago, a close friend noticed my anxiety and suggested I try meditating.<br>
        I gave it an honest attempt during my transition from undergrad to grad school,<br>
        but eventually, life got in the way, and I let it go. Around the same time,<br>
        my aunt introduced me to yoga. I instantly connected with it and practiced consistently<br>
        for a couple of years until the pandemic disrupted my routine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though I paused, the impact of those early experiences stayed with me.<br>
        As the pandemic began to wane, I found myself finishing grad school and facing<br>
        the uncertainty of job hunting—stressful, to say the least! It was then that<br>
        I decided to revisit yoga and meditation. This time, I truly embraced them,<br>
        integrating both into my daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since then, I’ve been practicing yoga and meditation every day. I pursued<br>
        further training, completing a yoga teacher certification, a<br>
        mindfulness-based stress reduction course, and attending a 10-day<br>
        meditation retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, I balance my career as a data scientist at a university with<br>
        my passion for yoga and meditation. I know how challenging it can be<br>
        to incorporate these practices into a busy schedule. But I also know<br>
        the profound benefits they offer. My goal is to share this journey<br>
        with you, helping you discover the benefits that yoga and meditation<br>
        have brought me—and countless others—over the centuries.
