    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>A few years ago, a close friend noticed my anxiety and suggested I try meditating. I gave it an honest attempt during my transition from undergrad to grad school, but eventually, life got in the way, and I let it go. Around the same time, my aunt introduced me to yoga. I instantly connected with it and practiced consistently for a couple of years until the pandemic disrupted my routine.</p>

    <p>Though I paused, the impact of those early experiences stayed with me. As the pandemic began to wane, I found myself finishing grad school and facing the uncertainty of job hunting—stressful, to say the least! It was then that I decided to revisit yoga and meditation. This time, I truly embraced them, integrating both into my daily life.</p>

    <p>Since then, I’ve been practicing yoga and meditation every day. I pursued further training, completing a yoga teacher certification, a mindfulness-based stress reduction course, and attending a 10-day meditation retreat.</p>

    <p>Today, I balance my career as a data scientist at a university with my passion for yoga and meditation. I know how challenging it can be to incorporate these practices into a busy schedule. But I also know the profound benefits they offer. My goal is to share this journey with you, helping you discover the benefits that yoga and meditation have brought me—and countless others—over the centuries.</p>
