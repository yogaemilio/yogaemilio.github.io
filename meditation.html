    <h1>Meditation</h1>
    
    <p>Meditation is like a mini vacation—a time to stop, rest, and discover. Often, we end up stressing about our vacations, but that’s counterproductive. Similarly, stressing about whether you’re meditating correctly is not helpful.</p>

    <p>Many people believe they're not good at meditation because they can't “stop thinking.” But this doesn’t make them bad at meditating—it simply means they’re human. Meditation isn’t about stopping thoughts.</p>

    <p>Others think they’re too busy for meditation. But that’s exactly why they need it. Meditation can fit into busy schedules. It doesn’t have to be sitting or lying down. You can meditate while walking, brushing your teeth, washing your hands, or during other daily activities.</p>

    <p>Some feel that meditation isn’t for them because they’re too anxious. While it’s true that some people may need other approaches first, for many, meditation can be a powerful tool for managing anxiety. It doesn’t have to be about sitting still and focusing on your breath. It can involve movement and focusing on different objects, tailored to what works best for you at any given moment.</p>

    <p>Although I’m not currently offering public meditation sessions, I’m always happy to chat if you’re interested in learning more about how to integrate meditation into your life. Feel free to send me an email!</p>
