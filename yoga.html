    <h1>Yoga</h1>
    
    <p>My approach to teaching yoga is centered on making it 
    accessible and enjoyable for everyone, no matter where you 
    are on your journey. I offer beginner-friendly classes 
    designed for every body. If you have any concerns or feel 
    that yoga might not be for you, please don’t hesitate to 
    reach out—I’m here to chat and help you find your way into 
    yoga.</p>

    <p>I also host a free, beginner-friendly 1-hour yoga class 
    on Zoom most Mondays at 6pm CDT. If you’re interested in 
    joining, just send me an email, and I’ll get you set up!</p>

    <p>Yoga is something I love sharing with others, especially 
    those who may not have had easy access to it before. If you’re 
    part of a group that’s interested in a class, I’d be delighted 
    to connect. Let’s work together to make yoga accessible to 
    everyone.</p>
