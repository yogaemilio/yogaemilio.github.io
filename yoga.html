    <h2>My Teaching</h2>
    
    <p>My approach to teaching yoga is centered on making it accessible and enjoyable for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. I offer beginner-friendly classes designed for every body. If you have any concerns or feel that yoga might not be for you, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to chat and help you find your way into yoga.</p>

    <p>I also host a free, beginner-friendly 1-hour yoga class on Zoom most Mondays at 6pm CDT. If you’re interested in joining, just send me an email, and I’ll get you set up!</p>

    <p>Yoga is something I love sharing with others, especially those who may not have had easy access to it before. If you’re part of a group that’s interested in a class, I’d be delighted to connect. Let’s work together to make yoga accessible to everyone.</p>

    <h2>Benefits and Risks of Yoga</h2>
    
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga-what-you-need-to-know">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a>, research suggests that yoga may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help improve general wellness by relieving stress, supporting good health habits, and improving mental/emotional health, sleep, and balance.</li>
        <li>Relieve neck pain, migraine or tension-type headaches, and pain associated with knee osteoarthritis. It may also have a small benefit for low-back pain.</li>
        <li>Help people with overweight or obesity lose weight.</li>
        <li>Help people quit smoking.</li>
        <li>Help people manage anxiety symptoms or depression.</li>
        <li>Relieve menopause symptoms.</li>
        <li>Be a helpful addition to treatment programs for substance use disorders.</li>
        <li>Help people with chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Yoga is generally considered a safe form of physical activity for healthy people when performed properly, under the guidance of a qualified instructor. However, as with other forms of physical activity, injuries can occur. The most common injuries are sprains and strains, and the parts of the body most commonly injured are the knee or lower leg. Serious injuries are rare. The risk of injury associated with yoga is lower than that for higher-impact physical activities.</p>
    
    <p>Older adults may need to be particularly cautious when practicing yoga. The rate of yoga-related injuries treated in emergency departments is higher in people age 65 and older than in younger adults.</p>
    
    <p>To reduce your chances of getting hurt while doing yoga:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice yoga under the guidance of a qualified instructor. Learning yoga on your own without supervision has been associated with increased risks.</li>
        <li>If you’re new to yoga, avoid extreme practices such as headstands, shoulder stands, the lotus position, and forceful breathing.</li>
        <li>Be aware that hot yoga has special risks related to overheating and dehydration.</li>
        <li>Pregnant women, older adults, and people with health conditions should talk with their health care providers and the yoga instructor about their individual needs. They may need to avoid or modify some yoga poses and practices. Some of the health conditions that may call for modifications in yoga include preexisting injuries, such as knee or hip injuries, lumbar spine disease, severe high blood pressure, balance issues, and glaucoma.</li>
    </ul>
