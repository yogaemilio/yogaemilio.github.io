    <h1>Yoga</h1>
    
    <p>My approach to teaching yoga is centered on making it accessible and enjoyable for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. I offer beginner-friendly classes designed for every body. If you have any concerns or feel that yoga might not be for you, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to chat and help you find your way into yoga.</p>

    <p>I also host a free, beginner-friendly 1-hour yoga class on Zoom most Mondays at 6pm CDT. If you’re interested in joining, just send me an email, and I’ll get you set up!</p>

    <p>Yoga is something I love sharing with others, especially those who may not have had easy access to it before. If you’re part of a group that’s interested in a class, I’d be delighted to connect. Let’s work together to make yoga accessible to everyone.</p>
